# Neovim (WIP)

## Updates

- I went back to my default statusline which is lualine.
- from using `jj` as my escape key, replaced it with `capslock` instead.
- Added `fcitx.nvim` plugin which allows me to automatically switch to active input method.
- Added `image.nvim` which allows me to view images within the terminal using the backend `ueberzug`.
- Removed plugins that I don't really need like the rich presence for Discord.
